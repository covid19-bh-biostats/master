# Introduction

In late 2019, a previously unknown virus began spreading within the population of the Wuhan-city 
in the Hubei province of China [@Huang-Jan2020]. The virus, identified as a new type of coronavirus [@WHO-sitrep1],
has since spread over the globe as a pandemic of an unprecedented scale [@WHO-press-pandemic,@WHO-sitrep78].

Fast spread and seriousness of the novel coronavirus disease (*CoVID-19*) has prompted international and national
actions to slow the spread of CoVID-19 and mitigate its impact on society [TODO citation].
Due to novelty of the disease, its clinical and epidemiological traits are largely uncertain [TODO] and
under active investigation [TODO]. This has forced policymakers around the globe to introduce a variety of
restrictions, many of which are based on imprecise models and forecasts due to uncertainties in model parameters [TODO].

In this work we address the parameter uncertainties and modeling difficulties. We provide a review
of previous models used in analyzing and forecasting the CoVID-19 epidemic in different geographical locations;
followed by a summary of the most important epidemiological parameters in the reviewed studies.
Next, we have developed a Python software package [*SEIR*](https://github.com/covid19-bh-biostats/seir/) 
implementing a modular SEIR-model that can be used for epidemic forecasting including, e.g., age-structure, 
social contact patterns, and restriction policies of the area of interest. We use the *SEIR* package
to fit the model parameters in various geographical locations and continue with a pattern-search among the 
estimated parameters. We conclude this paper with a summary and outlook.

# Previous works on modeling COVID-19 epidemics

## Literature Review

In the literature, we can find multiple approaches to estimate the epidemic parameters. Given the high uncertainty faced with a novel epidemic disease, mathematical models and statistical analysis have proven an important tool to understand the covid-19 pandemic. The Basic Reproduction Number (R0) is one of the most important parameters in epidemic transmission dynamics since describes the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. 

Early studies such Zhao et al [@Zhao_Jan2020] estimated that the mean R0 in the initial phase of the outbreak in mainland China ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 by using serial intervals of MERS and SARS-1 coronavirus. Riou et al [@Riou_Jan2020] were able to explain the early human-to-human transmission with a simulation study and values of R0 around 2.2 (1.4-3.8 90% density interval) in agreement with Li et al [@Li_Jan2020] that estimated R0 from data about the 425 first patients to be 2.2 (1.4-3.9 95% CI) among other parameters. We can find slightly higher estimates in other studies such Read et al [@Read_Jan2020] but in general the estimates of R0 are consistent around 2-3. All these results are significantly larger than 1, indicating the potential of the novel coronavirus to cause outbreaks and calling for an international surveillance and control efforts. 

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other territories in China and other countries in Asia and Europe revealed the pandemic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and we can find several mathematical models to  forecast the spread of the disease to other territories [@Wu_Jan2020][@Li_March2020][@Zhang_April2020]. Compartmental models are commonly used to model epidemics, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered metapopulation models have been used to describe the dynamics of covid-19 [@Li_March2020][@Heiden_March2020][Walker_March2020][@Casares_March2020]. 

The epidemiological modeling of non-pharmaceutical interventions informed policymaking in the UK and other countries, Ferguson et al [@Ferguson_March2020] performed analyses to estimate  the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the virus expansion in Great Britain. According to the study of Walker et al [10], mitigations strategies could save 20 million lives globally.  Casares and Khan [@Casares_March2020] developed a dynamic model based on the SIR model and calibrated the parameters to Spanish data in order to show the implications of social interaction and mobility restrictions over the COVID-19 in Spain. 

Related to the seasonality of the SARS-CoV-2, the results from current data analysis  have indicate a relationship between transmission and temperature/humidity [@Luo_Feb2020]. However, Luo et al concluded that changes in weather alone will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts from different chinese provinces data. Neher et al explored through simulations the potential impact of seasonal forcing on the pandemic, predicting a peak in winter 2020/2021 after a transient reduction during the warmer months [@Neher_March2020]. 

## Epidemic parameters

The produced SEIR model supports the following main parameters (a full list is available through the model documentation [here](https://seir.readthedocs.io/) )

Table 1: Outline of main parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| incubation_period | Incubation period of the disease in days. |
| infectious_period | How long a patient can infect others (in days) after the incubation period. |
| initial_R0  | Basic reproductive number of the disease |
| hospitalization_probability | Probability that an infected person needs hospitalization |
| hospitalization_duration | Average duration of a hospitalization in days |
| hospitalization_lag_from_onset | Average time (in days) from the onset of symptoms to admission to hospital |
| icu_probability | Probability that an infected person needs hospitalization. |
| icu_duration | Average duration of the need for intensive care in days. |
| icu_lag_from_onset | Average time (in days) from the onset of symptoms to admission to ICU. |
| death_probability | Probability that an infected person dies from the disease. |
| death_lag_from_onset | Average time from the onset of symptoms to death (in days). |
| population | The total population |

# SEIR software package

The python package implements SEIR modelling of covid19, and is available [here](https://github.com/covid19-bh-biostats/seir) under an [MIT License](https://github.com/covid19-bh-biostats/seir/blob/master/LICENSE).

A key aspect of the implementation is the support for multiple compartments (e.g. age groups, locations, etc), as well as the application of restrictions (e.g. social distancing, closing of schools etc) by introducing time-dependence in the infectivity rate.

The output of the package is always a `csv` file, with optional visualiazations. An example visualization of the results is shown in Figure 1.

# Patterns in location-specific epidemic parameters 


# Conclusions

We recommend to include some discussion or conclusion about your work. Feel free to modify the section title as it fits better to your manuscript.

# Future work

The model is robust, but we are now implementing a Genetic Algorithm wrapper that fits all underlying SEIR parameters to a given series of data points. The ultimate goal is to produce "time-series" of the parameters, so that a more coherent study of the different values across multiple cases can be performed. This includes aspects such as correlation to weather conditions (temperature, humidity, UV exposure, etc), as well as patterns based on the phylogenetic distance of the particular strains.
